#### ğŸ“˜ Learnings

Today, you will learn how to use two core operators in Apache Airflow:

Youâ€™ll also learn to **chain tasks** using `>>` to define execution order.

- **PythonOperator**
  - Takes a `python_callable` (function name).
  - Runs any Python logic (e.g., print logs, data checks).

- **BashOperator**
